## Experiment Methods

- `L-way n-shot`: `L` classes are randomly sampled from `support domain` into the support set. For each class, `n` images are chosen and placed into the support set. A different parameter, `m` determines the number of images per class that will be chosen for the query set. 

- `Prototypical Networks`: During training, episodes consisting of a support set S and a query set Q are sampled as described earlier. Then, a prototype for each class `k` is computed as the mean embedding of the samples
from the support set belonging to that class.

## Dataset Phases

### DS Phase 1

- All classes are part of both, train and test sets
- Split randomly using `src/split_train_test` in 70-30 ratio (ratio is per-class)
    - Use the function `split_data_all_classes()`

### DS Phase 2

- Most mis-classified classes are removed from the train set, and moved to the test set
- Specifically, `MEL`, `NV` and `BCC` are made the test set, and the model is trained only using the other 4 classes.
- Split deterministically using `src/split_train_test` in 70-30 ratio (ratio is per-class)
    - Use the function `split_test_classes()`
- This tests the strength of the similarity function learnt by the model

### DS Phase 3

- Complete data is split in 70-30 ratio (per-class ratio) into train and test sets
- Most mis-classified classes are removed from the train set, and moved to isolation (these are never seen by the trainer)
- Specifically, `MEL`, `NV` and `BCC` are moved to isolation set from test set, and the model is trained only using the other 4 classes
- This tests the strength of the similarity function learnt by the model
- Split randomly using `src/split_train_test` in 70-30 ratio (ratio is per-class)
    - Use the functions `split_data_all_classes()` and `split_test_classes()`, in succession

### DS Phase 4

- Complete data is split in 70-30 ratio (per-class ratio) into train and test sets
- Classes with the least number of images-per-class are removed from the train set, and moved to isolation (these are never seen by the trainer)
- Specifically, `AKIEC`, `VASC` and `DF` are moved to isolation set from test set, and the model is trained only using the other 4 classes
- This tests the ability of the model to learn the "similarity" function from a large dataset, and successfully use it to distinguish between classes that have limited annotated data available
- Split randomly using `src/split_train_test` in 70-30 ratio (ratio is per-class)
    - Use the functions `split_data_all_classes()` and `split_test_classes()`, in succession
